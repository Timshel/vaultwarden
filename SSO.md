# SSO using OpenId Connect

To use an external source of authentication your SSO will need to support OpenID Connect :

 - And OpenID Connect Discovery endpoint should be available
 - Client authentication will be done using Id and Secret.

A master password will still required and not controlled by the SSO (depending of your point of view this might be a feature ;).
This introduce another way to control who can use the vault without having to use invitation or using an LDAP.

## Configuration

The following configurations are available

 - `SSO_ENABLED` : Activate the SSO
 - `SSO_ONLY` : disable email+Master password authentication
 - `SSO_AUTHORITY` : the OpendID Connect Discovery endpoint of your SSO
 	- Should not include the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` part and no trailing `/`
 	- $SSO_AUTHORITY/.well-known/openid-configuration should return the a json document: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfigurationResponse
 - `SSO_SCOPES` : Optional, allow to override scopes if needed (default `"email profile"`)
 - `SSO_AUTHORIZE_EXTRA_PARAMS` : Optional, allow to add extra parameter to the authorize redirection (default `""`)
 - `SSO_CLIENT_ID` : Client Id
 - `SSO_CLIENT_SECRET` : Client Secret
 - `SSO_KEY_FILEPATH` : Optional public key to validate the JWT token (without it signature check will not be done).
 - `SSO_MASTER_PASSWORD_POLICY`: Optional Master password policy
 - `SSO_AUTH_ONLY_NOT_SESSION`: Enable to use SSO only for authentication not session lifecycle.

The callback url is : `https://your.domain/identity/connect/oidc-signin`

## Keycloak

Nothing specific just set:

- `SSO_AUTHORITY=https://${domain}/realms/${realm_name}`
- `SSO_CLIENT_ID`
- `SSO_CLIENT_SECRET`

## Authentik

Nothing specific just set:

- `SSO_AUTHORITY=https://${domain}/application/o/${application_name}/`
- `SSO_CLIENT_ID`
- `SSO_CLIENT_SECRET`

## GitLab

Create an application in your Gitlab Settings with

- `redirectURI`: https://your.domain/identity/connect/oidc-signin
- `Confidential`: `true`
- `scopes`: `openid`, `profile`, `email`

Then configure your server with

 - `SSO_AUTHORITY=https://gitlab.com`
 - `SSO_CLIENT_ID`
 - `SSO_CLIENT_SECRET`

## Google Auth

Google [Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect).
\
By default without extra [configuration](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#creatingclient) you wonÂ´t have a `refresh_token` and session will be limited to 1h.

Configure your server with :

  - `SSO_AUTHORITY=https://accounts.google.com`
  -   ```conf
	  SSO_AUTHORIZE_EXTRA_PARAMS="
	  access_type=offline
	  prompt=consent
	  "
	  ```
  - `SSO_CLIENT_ID`
  - `SSO_CLIENT_SECRET`

## Microsoft Entra ID

1. Create an "App registration" in [Entra ID](https://entra.microsoft.com/) following [Identity | Applications | App registrations](https://entra.microsoft.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade/quickStartType//sourceType/Microsoft_AAD_IAM).
2. From the "Overview" of your "App registration", you'll need the "Directory (tenant) ID" for the `SSO_AUTHORITY` variable and the "Application (client) ID" as the `SSO_CLIENT_ID` value.
3. In "Certificates & Secrets" create an "App secret" , you'll need the "Secret Value" for the `SSO_CLIENT_SECRET` variable.
4. In "Authentication" add https://vaultwarden.example.org/identity/connect/oidc-signin as "Web Redirect URI".
5. In "API Permissions" make sure you have `profile`, `email` and `offline_access` listed under "API / Permission name" (`offline_access` is required, otherwise no refresh_token is returned, see https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/17134).

Only the v2 endpooint is compliant with the OpenID spec, see https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/38427 and https://github.com/ramosbugs/openidconnect-rs/issues/122.

Your configuration should look like this:

* `SSO_AUTHORITY=https://login.microsoftonline.com/${Directory (tenant) ID}/v2.0`
* `SSO_SCOPES="email profile offline_access"`
* `SSO_CLIENT_ID=${Application (client) ID}`
* `SSO_CLIENT_SECRET=${Secret Value}`

## Authelia

To obtain a `refresh_token` to be able to extend session you'll need to add the `offline_access` scope.

Config will look like:

 - `SSO_SCOPES="email profile offline_access"`

## Session lifetime

Session lifetime is dependant on refresh token and access token returned after calling your sso token endpoint (grant type `authorization_code`).
If no refresh token is returned then the session will be limited to the access token lifetime.

Tokens are not persisted in VaultWarden but wrapped in JWT tokens and returned to the application (The `refresh_token` and `access_token` values returned by VW `identity/connect/token` endpoint).
Note that VaultWarden will always return a `refresh_token` for compatibility reasons with the web front and it presence does not indicate that a refresh token was returned by your sso (But you can decode its value with https://jwt.io and then check if the `token` field contain anything).

With a refresh token present, activity in the application will trigger a refresh of the access token when it's close to expiration ([5min](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/blob/0bcb45ed5caa990abaff735553a5046e85250f24/libs/common/src/auth/services/token.service.ts#L126) in web client).

Additionnaly for certain action a token check is performed, if we have a refresh token we will perform a refresh otherwise we'll call the user information endpoint to check the access token validity.

### Disabling SSO session handling

If you are unable to obtain a `refresh_token` or for any other reason you can disable SSO session handling and revert to the default handling.
You'll need to enable `SSO_AUTH_ONLY_NOT_SESSION=true` then access token will be valid for 2h and refresh token for a year.

### Debug information

Running with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` you'll be able to see information on token expiration.
